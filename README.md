Intercom to Watson Demo
================

Demo to show how n.io can be used to integrate Intercom customer service and
the IBM Watson API.

The first message of each conversation is sent through Watson's tone analyzer
and if a negative reaction is interpreted, it will send a slack notification to
the \#Intercom channel.
